# Perl from Other Languages

Perl cannot deny its origin in the classic ways of Unix. If you're familiar
with Unix and come across some Perl code for the first time, you'll probably
think it's some kind of weird mix between C and shell with some awk and sed
sauce thrown into it. But Perl is not just a Swiss army knife for text
processing: it is an elegant general-purpose programming language that does its
best to provide you, the programmer, with means to express your ideas in code
as seamlessly as possible, whatever languages you are know.

This document contains two sections. The first one shows you how to do common
constuctions from another language in Perl, staying as close to the original
style of the other language as possible: there's more than one way to do it, and
why not start with the way most familiar to you? The second section goes over
the most important features of Perl and compared them to what is found in other
languages you might be familiar with.
